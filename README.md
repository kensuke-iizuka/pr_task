## Datasets
In the class, teacher distributed original dataset and he said us not to distribute others. 

So you can't execute some programs(e.g. programs in `05` directory).

You can download MNIST and Cifar-10 datasets following link

- MNIST http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

- CIFAR-10 https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

I recommend you to download these datasets into `data` directory, if you want to execute programs in this repository without rewriting dataset path.
